## Goals
* this library should be simple as much as possible
* this library should be independent as much as possible *(if you need any other library, do not forget to edit dependecies in `package.json` and add the library files to `deps` dir)*
* each feature should have simple test page *(single `html` document)*

## How to start
 * Look at the table of responsibilities [here](https://github.com/GeoSmartCity-CIP/gsc-client/wiki/List-of-tasks-and-responsible-partner) and for a clarification use delivered mockups
 * Create a new branch [help](https://github.com/GeoSmartCity-CIP/gsc-client/wiki/git-workflow#starting-a-new-feature)
 * As an example you can use [this](https://github.com/GeoSmartCity-CIP/gsc-client/tree/feature/workflow-alert-event) if there is a bug, open issue
 * Start coding your feature
